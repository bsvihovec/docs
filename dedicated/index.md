## {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} architecture
{: #dedicatedarch}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} can be deployed in any [{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} SoftLayer data center ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://www.softlayer.com/data-centers){: new_window} around the world. {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} SoftLayer provides the highest performing cloud infrastructure. Each data center has 24 hour, 7 days a week security, and rigorous controls.

Each {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} deployment is dedicated to a single enterprise on {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} SoftLayer dedicated hardware in it's own private network. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} environments have the same security standards as the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in terms of infrastructure, operational, and physical security. However, developer access to the dedicated {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} is controlled by your LDAP policies, which can be configured by the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} team when they set up your environment. Within the dedicated environment, you can manage user roles and permissions. See [Managing users and permissions](/docs/admin/index.html#oc_useradmin) for details. The following figure depicts the logical architecture of a default {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} deployment.

![{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}](images/bm_dedicated_arch.png "{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} default architecture")

Figure 1. Detailed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} diagram default architecture
{: #figure01}

The significant architectureal components depicted in the previous architecture diagram include the following:

<dl>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud</dt>
<dd>
The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Cloud environment as a whole includes the following significant networking environments:
<ul>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public</li>
<li>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}</dt>
<dd>
At a minimum, this contains the Cloud Foundry components and some dedicated application services. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides both Cloud Foundry and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}-based compute environments. An enterprise might have one or both of these compute environments configured.<br>
An enterprise might add additional dedicated application services.<br>
Please refer to [table 2](#table02) for additional services and compute capabilities that may be added.
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public</dt>
<dd>
An {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} might include an outbound connection to an {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public region. This provides syndication of public services onto the dedicated catalog. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public service syndication provides a convenient method for developers to build applications hosted on their enterprise's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} and accessing services running in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public. The list of services that can be syndicated from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public shown on [table 4 of the Syndicated catalog section](#catalogdedicated).
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations</dt>
<dd>
{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} manages, monitors, and maintains the dedicated platform and dedicated services so you can focus on building innovative applications. The {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} Operations Support Services (OSS) team performs operations by using a VPN tunnel connection from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s Operations network.
</dd>
<dt>Enterprise</dt>
<dd>
The enterprise network environment may have a secured private bi-directional network link to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}. This allows applications hosted in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} to access services and resources in the enterprise, including data sources and enterprise services. This network link also allows {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} to use your LDAP for authentication of your enterprise's developers and administrators.<br>
<br>
There are several options for creating the secured private network link. Talk to your IBM technical specialist about the best networking option for your enterprise.<br>
<br>
The default connection from {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} to your enterprise network uses a Virtual Private Network (VPN). {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} has a Dedicated 1 Gbps Vyatta VPN termination configured for high availability.
<br>
In the default architecture for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} as shown in [figure 1](#figure01), there is no inbound network traffic directly from the Internet. If your enterprise wishes to allow Internet access to applications hosted on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}, the access must be configured through your Enterprise network.

## Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}
{: #dr}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Dedicated can be set up similarly to the way that it works when you use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Public provides a continuously available platform for innovation with multiple fail-safe measures to ensure that your orgs, spaces, and apps are always available. Deploying apps to multiple geographic regions enables continuous availability that protects against unplanned, simultaneous loss of multiple hardware or software components, or the loss of an entire data center, so that even in the event of a natural disaster in one geographic location, your distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public app instances in alternate geographic locations will be available.
{: shortdesc}

Disaster recovery for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_short}} Dedicated is made possible through continuous availability for your apps, the inherent high availability of the platform, and the ability to restore your instance in the event of a failure. You are responsible for enabling continuous availability of your apps by deploying to multiple regions. High availability is built in at the platform level through  technologies included in Cloud Foundry and other components. And, you can work together with IBM to ensure your data is properly backed up in the case that you need to restore your instance at any time.

### Enabling continuous availability for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}
{: #enabling}

By default, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public deploys to multiple geographic locations. However, you must do the following to enable globally distributed {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} instances:

* Ensure that your developers are deploying apps in more than one region, either through a manual or automated process. Regions should be more than 200 km apart from each other to ensure that a natural disaster cannot affect both geographic locations.
* Configure a global load balancer, like Akamai or Dyn, to point to apps in at least two different regions.

**Note**: Not all {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services support regional distribution. When you construct an application, if you want to achieve geographic distribution, then you must also make sure that the services that are used by that application have data synchronization as a key feature.

#### Deploying {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} apps to multiple geographic locations
{: #deploying}

To deploy into a second location or multiple locations, you must follow a process similar to the one you took to enable your primary geographic location:

1. Enable a new dedicated environment to host additional instances of your applications. To create a new environment, contact your IBM sales team to initiate the process. For more information about setting up a dedicated instance, see [Setting up {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}](/docs/dedicated/index.html#setupdedicated). You must log in separately to access each environment. Each physical location for the hosted environments should be a minimum of 200 km away from the original location to ensure availability.
2. Obtain the unique domain name where your new deployed app will be hosted.  For example, if your original domain is *mycompany.caeast.bluemix.net*, then you can create a new local environment with a new domain such as *mycompany.cawest.bluemix.net*, and deploy to the new domain.
3. Each time you deploy your original app, also deploy to the new location. For more information about deploying, see [Uploading your app](/docs/starters/upload_app.html).


#### Enabling a global load balancer for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}}
{: #glb}

A global load balancer not only ensures continuous availability and is required for disaster recovery, but it also has several additional benefits:

* Routes users to the closest {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} region by default
* Routes based on performance
* Selectively directs a percentage of traffic to a new application version
* Provides site failover based on region health check
* Provides site failover based on application health check
* Uses weighted routing between endpoints

You can choose a global load balancer such as Akamai or Dyn. For more about using Akamai as a global load balancer, see [Global traffic management ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://www.akamai.com/us/en/solutions/products/web-performance/global-traffic-management.jsp "Opens in new window"){: new_window}. For more about using Dyn as a global load balancer, see [4 Reasons Businesses Are Taking Global Load Balancing to the Cloud ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](http://dyn.com/blog/4-reasons-businesses-are-taking-global-load-balancing-to-the-cloud/){: new_window}.

### High availability
{: #ha}

In addition to enabling continuous availability, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} also provides high availability across the platform by using technologies built into Cloud Foundry and other components.

These technologies include the following:

<dl>
<dt>DEA Scalability in Cloud Foundry</dt>
<dd>A Cloud Foundry <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html" target="_blank">Droplet Execution Agent (DEA) <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> performs health checks on the apps running within it. If there is a problem with the app or the DEA itself, it deploys additional instances of the app to an alternate DEA to address the issue. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/high-availability.html" target="_blank">Configuring CF for High Availability with Redundancy <img src="../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a>.
<p>To ensure high availability for your applications, you need enough compute resources to balance the load, and you might also require additional compute resources to support a possible failure. If you need to scale your environment by increasing your DEA pool to be prepared for a failure or address a spike in the load for your app instances, you can work with your IBM representative to order additional DEAs and ensure that you have the appropriate hardware to support the added resources.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>{{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} redundancy</dt>
<dd>With {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} in dedicated environments, data in each cloud storage cluster is written multiple times, and storage clusters are configured with auto-healing capabilities in case of drive failure. If there is a problem with a virtual server, {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} tries to restart the virtual server on another host.</dd>
<dt>Metadata backup</dt>
<dd>Metadata is backed up using {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} EVault Backup to a location that is a minimum of 200 km away.</dd>
</dl>

##Restoring your dedicated instance
{: #restorededicated}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_dedicated_notm}} settings, metadata, and configurations are backed up regularly to prepare for any unplanned outages in the environment. Your data that you are responsible for backing up includes application data, cloud database services data, and object stores.

As part of the data backup, which includes system metadata and configurations, IBM completes the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Encrypts all backup copies and manages encryption keys</li>
<li>Monitors and manages backup activity</li>
<li>Provides the encrypted backup files</li>
<li>Restores the requested data</li>
<li>Manages scheduling conflicts between backup and fix management operations</li>
</ul>

Because protection of private data is critical, IBM needs your collaboration when dealing with backup file management, so that the files are not moved outside of your data centers. Specifically, IBM asks that you complete the following tasks:

<ul>
<li>Move a copy of your encrypted backup data off-site, just as you would for any other backup data that you manage.</li>
<li>Provide the backup files for the IBM operator in case of any need to restore.</li>
</ul>
